# U.S. States Guessing Game

A simple and interactive U.S. States Guessing Game built using Python, Turtle graphics, and the Pandas library.
This project was created while learning how to work with Pandas, CSV files, and basic GUI interaction using Turtle.

## How the Game Works
- A blank U.S. map is displayed
- The player types the name of a U.S. state
- If the guess is correct, the state name appears on the map
- shows the current score
- The player can type “Exit” at any time to stop the game
- When the game ends, a CSV file is generated containing the states the player missed



## Features
- Interactive U.S. map
- Real-time state name placement
- Exit option at any time
- Automatically saves missed states to a CSV file


## How to Run
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone this repository
3. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
4. Run the game:

## What I learned 
- Reading and writing CSV and txt files using Pandas
- Working with DataFrames
- Handling user input
- Using Turtle graphics for simple game development
- Breaking a project into logical steps

   python main.py

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects
- Add a timer or difficulty levels
- Improve UI design (colors, fonts)
